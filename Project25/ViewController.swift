 Multipeer connectivity requires four new classes:

1.MCSession is the manager class that handles all multipeer connectivity for us.

2.MCPeerID identifies each user uniquely in a session.

3.MCAdvertiserAssistant is used when creating a session, telling others that we exist and handling invitations.

4.MCBrowserViewController is used when looking for sessions, showing users who is nearby and letting them join.

 We're going to use all four of them in our app, but only three need to be properties.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 all multipeer services on iOS must declare a service type, which is a 15-digit string that uniquely identify your service. Those 15 digits can contain only the letters A-Z, numbers and hyphens, and it's usually preferred to include your company in there somehow
 
 This service type is used by both MCAdvertiserAssistant and MCBrowserViewController to make sure your users only see other users of the same app. They both also want a reference to your MCSession instance so they can take care of connections for you
